                    <p>
                        During her decades of marriage, Ashley Davis' skin has deteriorated severely due to constant stress, irregular use of sunscreen, occasional wine, and a few cigarettes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she overheard her husband of 43 years refer to her as a <strong>“wrinkled old prune” </strong> the Melbourne native, now 67, decided to embark on a wrinkle transformation journey to feel young in her body again — and has wiped an impressive 32 years off her face!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Read on to discover how Ashley Davis successfully restored decades of youth to her face and got revenge on her ex-husband using a group of Beverly Hills Doctor's groundbreaking tips.

                        <i>
                            After her husband DIVORCED her because she was “TOO OLD” Ashley Davis promised to get revenge by getting the youngest, most beautiful face she has had in over 20 years.
                            She considered cosmetic surgery but due to being evaluated as a “high risk patient” by her doctor she couldn’t proceed. <strong>Then what she heard from Dr. Feldman changed her life.</strong>
                        </i>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My skin was tight and pretty when I was younger, and I never had any wrinkle problems. I graduated college without a single wrinkle on my face. When I went to work at a local corporate office, <strong>I developed some bad habits</strong> like not putting on sun screen daily, drinking alcohol, and occasionally even smoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the decades passed me by, my face shriveled up. The wrinkles snuck up on me. I was <strong>miserable, humiliated and embarrassed</strong>... When I went out with friends, I found myself constantly feeling insecure and running to the bathroom to put on more makeup. I did not like seeing my own reflection and started avoiding close-up mirrors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, I overheard my husband refer to me as a <strong>“wrinkled old prune.”</strong> When I confronted him, he went as far as boldly telling me <strong>“I CHEATED on you because you’re too old and I'm no longer attracted to you!”</strong> and then he asked for a DIVORCE! This was a painful, humiliating shock. Until that point, no one had ever addressed the fact that my face had gotten so wrinkled and old and I had been in denial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I am thankful for that comment because it motivated me. I knew I needed to get my face and skin healthy for me, and me alone. Had I not changed my lifestyle, I am certain I was on my way to looking like an old, dried-up prune. I took a long, painful look in the mirror and knew <strong>I had to do something fast!</strong>"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ashley tried one method after another with little or no results. She even considered plastic surgery but was hesitant to go under the knife. Thing were looking hopeless until a few weeks ago when she contacted us to help get her in touch with the world renowned Dr. Feldman, <strong> Ashley listened to  him EXPOSE Hollywood's hidden skincare secret. </strong>
                        <img src="inc/comp2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    </p>
                  <p>
                        Dr. Feldman has reserved this secret technique only for private clients who want to look 10 to 20 years younger
                        fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Ashley found out about it, she was so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective this technique was, that she had to test it herself.

                    <p>Connie McDonald said she felt that it was her duty to let her fans know.  She was tired of hearing countless stories of her viewers losing $1000's on expensive anti aging products, or dangerous plastic surgeries. As a result, a few weeks ago <strong>she asked us to expose the simple solution from Dr. Feldman that he had previously only shared with his private clients...to everyone reading FitDaily Magazine!</strong></p>

                    <p>Dr Feldman's big skincare secret is that after months and months of pain staking tests and research, his team discovered 2 products that when combined <strong> literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month.

                    <p class="m-t-25">These ingredients are all tested, safe &amp; proven to work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines especially at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
                    <p><strong>Neodermyl, K Vita C &amp; Elix-IR: The Fountain of Youth:</strong> <br>
                     The first piece of the anti aging puzzle is the combined effect of <strong>Neodermyl, K Vita C &amp; Elix-IR</strong>.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-center"><i> "These three ingredients are the secret to cheat your age". -Dr. Robert Feldman</i></h5>
                    <p>Neodermyl, K Vita C &amp; Elix-IR penetrate deep into damaged skin and stimulates the production of new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying all the three ingredients to your skin caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. This is why <a href="http://siteloading.com/path/out.php?sxid=983qtj53f30h" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had all of the key ingredients in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
                    <img src="inc/test1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Mitostime, Aquaxyl &amp; Sytenol A:</strong> <br> He said the final ingredients, when combined properly with the previous three, literally makes your face <strong> look two decades younger in weeks! </strong> Mitostime, Aquaxyl & Sytenol A work by binding to moisture. They can hold up to 1,000 times their weight in water, making them an excellent natural skin plumper. The combination helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of all three was found in <a href="http://siteloading.com/path/out.php?sxid=983qtj53f30h" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>.</p>

                    <p class="small-text">"When <strong>all these ingredients are combined</strong> into one, what it does is it gets rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and helps your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the cream or the serum that contains the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only one we could find during our research was <a href="http://siteloading.com/path/out.php?sxid=983qtj53f30h" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my private clients."</p>
                    <h4>"How do I use it?"</h4>
                    <p>It's actually very simple. You simply apply the product before bed daily for 15 days. Our Doctors have said that, "The trick is to apply <a href="http://siteloading.com/path/out.php?sxid=983qtj53f30h"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a> every night consistently and make sure to stay hydrated during the day". The product contains high concentrations of the purest ingredients in just the right concentrations. Our team at FitDaily also discovered that <?php echo $offerName; ?> contains all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl <strong> (also known as facelift in a jar) </strong> and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Neodermyl).</p>

                    <p>As excited as we were after the show and the flood of emails and letters, we wanted to research these anti-aging ingredients ourselves before we wrote this feature piece praising them. We decided to take one volunteer from our readers. You've already met Ashley Davis, who jumped at the chance to trial this combo. Here are her results...</p>

Ashley said she decided to trial <?php echo $offerName; ?> because she was so frustrated that nothing else has produced results. She was even considered a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. <?php echo $offerName; ?> was somewhat of a last resort for her. </p>

                        "Eventually <strong> the word of my youthful transformation got to my ex-husband </strong> who had divorced me for being "too old". He came crawling back and asking to take me out to dinner at one of the fanciest restaurants in town - the very same restaurant he used to take me to when were were dating decades ago. He told me that he had "made a huge mistake" and that he had realized that he "can't live without me". He called, texted, and emailed me day and night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually I had to change my phone number and email address. Finally one day, he got the nerve to come straight to my house to try to convince me to give him a chance! This is what I had been waiting for. I had gone over this conversation in my mind a thousand times and told him exactly how I felt, <strong> "I'm glad that you divorced me and I'll NEVER take you back - you're just too old and boring for me now." </strong> The look on his face was priceless!"

                            <p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>

                            <p>My sister did this a few months ago, I waited to order my trials to see if it really worked and then they stopped giving out the trials! what a dumb move that turned out to be. glad to see the trials are back again, I wont make the same mistake.</p>

                            <p>Yes this stuff is amazing! My best friend Gina uses this, I've been trying for years to get rid of my wrinkles and nothing was helping. You alerted me to the possibility of achieving my goals, which is looking great for my daughter's wedding. I just ordered the free trials of the skin creams and I have a very good feeling about them!!</p>
