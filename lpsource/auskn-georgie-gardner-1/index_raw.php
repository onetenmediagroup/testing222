Believe it or not, an inside set member revealed that she got in trouble for seeking her own outside help for her makeup and beauty treatment!</em></strong></p>
                    <p>For those of you who watch, you may have noticed this yourself. Georgie Gardner has become more beautiful and even younger looking since she started on the show in 2002. But what exactly did she do that resulted in her producers getting upset with her "age defiance?" Well, it just so happens that she's good friends with Dr. Oz and it seems that his latest formula is the REAL reason for her youthful look. Although it didn't make sponsors like L'Oreal happy, it makes normal people like us very happy because it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!</p>
                    <!--<p>A source close to Georgie revealed that Dr. Oz had shared with her a shocking skincare secret - one that ended up changing her life (and her face!) each and every day. Upon more research, we've discovered that she - and many Hollywood actresses - have been secretly using this incredible "elixir of youth" too.</p>-->

				  <p class="m-t-25"><img src="inc/gg2.jpg" width="636" height="382" class="img-responsive"></p>
				  <p class="m-t-25">Sponsors pay millions to advertise their products with NBC, but we're now learning their sponsors (and NBC, too) are FURIOUS with Georgie Gardner. Why? Because she failed to let NBC know about her massive skincare empire, which is actually a HUGE competitor to NBC's sponsors. After checking with our sources, the reason they were furious was because the products Georgie mentioned are half the price and twice as effective as theirs. Women are going crazy over this new Wrinkle Remover.</p>
				  <p>At 46, <strong>Georgie</strong> is looking better than ever. She looks even more radiant and youthful than she did when she was years younger! Well, it just so happens that she decided to share her favorite anti-aging product on live TV.<br>
			      </p>
				  <p>A few weeks ago on the Dr. Oz show, he shared the secret behind his celebrity clients who want to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Georgie&nbsp;came on the show &amp; went into detail on the products Dr.Oz has her use &amp; how it has saved her career. We were so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was, we had to test it ourselves and write a feature article on the results! He explained how it not only saved Georgie’s career, but other celebrities’ whose careers were at risk due to their age, shockingly enough it’s a simple trick you can try too! The truth is out now &amp; we have the inside scoop!</p>

					<span class="h4">AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK INTO THE Georgie Gardner ANTI-AGING WRINKLE CREAM</span> <img src="inc/gg3.jpg" class="img-responsive">
					<i>After years of not taking care of her skin, Georgie’s age was showing. With deep wrinkles, sagging skin and fine lines, she needed help. She credits <a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a> for taking at least 20 years off her face and restored her confidence.</i>

				  <p class="m-t-25"><em>“My skin was tight and pretty when I was younger, and I never had any wrinkle problems. I graduated college without a single wrinkle on my face. When I went to work at a local corporate office,&nbsp;<strong>I developed some bad habits</strong>&nbsp;like not putting on sun screen daily, drinking alcohol, and occasionally even smoking.</em>”</p>

					<div>
					  <p>Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for his high paying celebrity clients until recently. He said he felt like he had to let his viewers know because he was tired of hearing the countless stories of his viewers throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago&nbsp;<strong>he shared the simple solution he had previously only shared with his celeb clients to everyone watching his show!</strong></p>
					  <p>He actually discovered this anti aging miracle when multiple celebrity friends and clients were constantly reaching out to him hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.</p>

					<p>On his show he said he was thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, his team came across 2 products that when combined<strong>&nbsp;literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and cost next to nothing</strong>! The product he mentioned was<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>.</strong></p>
					<hr>



					  <p><img src="inc/science-new-face-cream.jpg" alt="science-new-face-cream" width="500" height="300" class="img-responsive" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
					  <p>These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
					  <p><strong>Proprietary Bisophere, The Fountain of Youth:</strong></p>
					  <p>The first piece of the anti aging puzzle&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Oz</strong>&nbsp;talked about was&nbsp;<strong>Proprietary Bisophere</strong>.</p>
					  <p><img src="inc/ozskin.jpg" alt="ozskin" width="600" height="317" class="img-responsive" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><strong><em><br>“Proprietary Bisophere is the secret to cheat your age”. -Dr. Oz</em></strong></p>
					  <p>Proprietary Bisophere penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It’s all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Proprietary Bisophere to your skin caused a&nbsp;<strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. Dr. Oz said this is why&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>&nbsp;is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Proprietary Bisophere in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
					  <p><img src="inc/test1.jpg" alt="test1" width="600" height="202" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" class="img-responsive"></p>
					  <p><strong>QuSome:</strong><br>
					    He said the second piece, when combined properly with Proprietary Bisophere, literally makes your face&nbsp;<strong>look two decades younger in weeks!</strong> QuSome works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. QuSome helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of QuSome was found in&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>.</p>
					  <p><img src="inc/test2.jpg" alt="test2" width="600" height="202" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" class="img-responsive"></p>
				  <p><em>“What&nbsp;<strong>Proprietary Bisophere &amp; QuSome</strong>&nbsp;do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only one we found during our research was&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>. This is what Georgie Gardner&nbsp;uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”</em>&nbsp;– Dr. Oz</p>
					  <p>This product was a celeb exclusive secret until Julia Belaya, a 59-year-old mother of three from Los Angeles, California was featured on&nbsp;<strong>The Meredith Vieira Show</strong>. Her testimonial revolutionized the industry. A perfect example of how a little smart-thinking and ingenuity can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of dollars in doctors’ bills.</p>
					  <p>Like most women, Julia didn’t have the extra cash to try out every celebrity-endorsed anti-aging “miracle cream” out there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like plastic surgery or facelifts.</p>

					        <p>After the first day of using&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>, I was surprised at how wonderful it made my skin feel. It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner.</p>
					        <p>I don’t know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy – the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face.</p>
					        <p>After the product was absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.</p>

					    <p><strong>DAY 5:</strong></p>
					    <p>After five days of using&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>, I was shocked at the drastic results.</p>
					    <p><strong>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles – without question – were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</strong></p>
					    <p>I was astonished by the results and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!</p>

					        <p><strong>DAY&nbsp;14:</strong></p>
					        <p>After 14 days of using the Georgie Gardner&nbsp;anti-aging-wrinkle cream, not only had all my doubts and skepticism absolutely vanished – SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>
					        <p>The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I’ve never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!</p>
					        <p>After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn’t believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</p>

					  <h3><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>
					  <p>Using&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank"><?php echo $offerName; ?></a>&nbsp;removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin.</p>
					  <br>
					  <strong>Will This Work For You?</strong> There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, most of them are ridiculously expensive. And with so many options it’s only natural for you to be skeptical about the results. So instead of making promises, we simply challenge you to do what&nbsp;<strong>Meredith</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Georgie&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Oz</strong> recommended to Julia Belaya:&nbsp;<a href="http://gkpjk.voluumtrk.com/click" target="_blank">try it for yourself!</a></div>

                            <p>I have been using this Anti Aging cream
for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good
 as Angelina Jolie, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for shipping!
 My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every
day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>

                            <p>I saw Angelina Jolie presenting <?php echo $offerName; ?> on CNN a while ago and am
still using the cream. I've been using the products for about 6 wks.
Honestly, this is unbelievable, all I have to say is WOW.</p>

                            <p>A friend of mine used and recommended it
to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered the product and received it within 3
days. The results have
been incredible and I can't wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring.</p>

                            <p>probably I'm a bit older than most of you
 folks. but <?php echo $offerName; ?> worked for me too! LOL! I can't say anything more
 exciting. Thanks for the inspiration!</p>

                            <p>My sister did this a few months ago, I
waited to order my sample to see if it really worked and then they
stopped giving out the samples! what a dumb move that turned out to be.
glad to see the samples are back again, I wont make the same mistake.</p>

                            <p>Yes this stuff is amazing! My best friend
 Gina uses this, I've been trying for years to get rid of my wrinkles
and nothing was helping. You alerted me to the possibility of achieving
my goals, which is looking great for my daughter's wedding. I just
ordered the free sample and I have a very good
feeling about it!!</p>
